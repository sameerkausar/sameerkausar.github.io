									<h3>About Sameeer Kausar</h3>
									<p>Sameer started his dancing career his junior year of high school with Lynbrook Bhangra. Once he graduated and went to UCSD for undergrad, he joined the nationally rank team, Da Real Punjabiz. When he joined the team in his second year of college, he could barely dance on count. With hard work and determination, Sameer turned into one of the most dominate dancers on the team. He lead the way in multiple placings at competitions with the most notable being their first place performance at Bruin Bhangra 2016.</p>
									<p>Now graduated, Sameer has moved back up to the bay and currently dances with Bhangra Empire. He has performed as the halftime show at a Warriors game. He has helped create choreography videos with millions of views. He also taught with Bhangra Empire both adult beginners and adult intermediate.</p>

                    <p>"I’ve really enjoyed Sameer’s bhangra class, he is a great communicator and a dance star! Sameer teaches the choreography efficiently while still keeping the mood light and fun, which is a rare talent. He inspired our class to perform our best without ever stressing us out. I hope to take more dance classes from Sameer, he is a gem!" -Jane Corpos</p>
                    <p>"It was an awesome experience being Sameer's student this Fall Dance Off session. Sameer taught every Bhangra move step by step with so much ease that every student was able to pick up the steps so fast. Also, loved the number of practices we would do in a single class. Appreciate Sameer's dedication to meet the class off hours for formations and taking out some time to ensure that we are up to the mark. I would love to be his student again!" -Aparna Chaturvedi</p>

										<h3>Testimonials</h3>
										<p>"Sameer is not only a great Bhangra dancer but also a great teacher! I took his summer class with Bhangra Empire and the classes were fun. He would break down the steps and help pick up steps in case anyone had any questions or doubts with a positive and helpful attitude. Sameer never got impatient and in fact he was very encouraging and at times funny. I would definitely take another class with him." -Nikita Tayal</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>"Without any doubt, I can say Sameer is one of the best instructors. He puts great efforts in teaching the class in a fun environment. He makes it a safe environment for people to easily learn and provide feedback to him as well as others. He likes to motivate the group and brings a lot of energy to the class. What amazed me the most was how smoothly & efficiently Sameer was able to lay out the formations without getting impatient at any time. I would happily attend his class again in future. Cheers!" -Neeraj Tayal</p>
