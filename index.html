									<h3>About Sameeer Kausar</h3>
									<p>Sameer started his dancing career his junior year of high school with Lynbrook Bhangra. Once he graduated and went to UCSD for undergrad, he joined the nationally rank team, Da Real Punjabiz. When he joined the team in his second year of college, he could barely dance on count. With hard work and determination, Sameer turned into one of the most dominate dancers on the team. He lead the way in multiple placings at competitions with the most notable being their first place performance at Bruin Bhangra 2016.</p>
									<p>Now graduated, Sameer has moved back up to the bay and currently dances with Bhangra Empire. He has performed as the halftime show at a Warriors game. He has helped create choreography videos with millions of views. He also taught with Bhangra Empire both adult beginners and adult intermediate.</p>
